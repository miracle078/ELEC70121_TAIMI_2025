# Lab Tutorial -- ELEC70121 -- Session 2

## Overview 
This repository contains lab codes for ELEC70121 Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (2024-2025, session 2). The labs cover various topics in AI techniques applied to medical imaging.

## Requirements
This code can be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) or your own computer.

To run the code on your own computer, please first install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/) and then run the following command to create a virtual environment and install the required packages. 
```python
conda env create --file trustworthy_env.yaml
```
